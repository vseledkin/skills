# Citation rules (practical)

## When to cite

- Empirical claims (numbers, trends, “X improves Y”, prevalence, benchmarks)
- Definitions that are not universally standard
- Claims about “best practices”, “standard approaches”, “state of the art”
- Historical statements and attributions

Do not cite for obvious/common knowledge (but when in doubt, cite).

## Source quality (prefer in this order)

1. Standards / specs (e.g., ISO, IETF RFCs) when relevant
2. Peer-reviewed primary literature (original paper introducing the result)
3. High-quality surveys / textbooks
4. Official documentation from the primary vendor/organization
5. Reputable secondary sources (major institutions, established media)

Avoid using low-quality blogs as primary evidence when a primary source exists.

## Representation

- Do not claim a source supports more than it does. Summarize precisely.
- If sources conflict, say so and cite both.
- Keep citations close to the sentence they support.

## Default in-text + references format

- In text: numeric brackets like `[1]`, `[2]`.
- References list: numbered entries, each including title + venue/publisher + year + stable link (DOI/URL).

## Approval gating (interactive workflow)

When adding new external sources, present a short list (title + why it’s relevant + link) and ask the user for approval before inserting them into the paper.
