# Scientific writing guidelines (operational)

## Claim hygiene

- Separate **facts**, **hypotheses**, **assumptions**, and **opinions**.
- If a statement is not common knowledge, either cite it or label it as a hypothesis/assumption.
- Prefer calibrated language: “suggests”, “is consistent with”, “we hypothesize”, “in this work we propose”.

## Structure

- One purpose per section; one idea per paragraph.
- Lead with the thesis: problem → gap → contribution.
- Put definitions early; avoid term drift.

## Precision

- Replace adjectives with measurable statements (or remove).
- Avoid absolute terms (“always”, “never”) unless you can defend them.
- Prefer simple sentences when the meaning is technical.

## Reproducibility (even for conceptual papers)

- Give enough detail that a reader could implement a prototype or replicate the reasoning steps.
- Provide explicit examples, toy cases, or a running illustrative scenario.

## Ethics & privacy

- Remove or anonymize personally identifying or sensitive details from dictated notes unless the user explicitly wants them included.
- If the content is medical/legal/financial advice, include appropriate caveats and keep claims conservative and well-cited.
