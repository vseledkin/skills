# Draft readiness checklist

## Structure

- [ ] Title matches the contribution.
- [ ] Abstract states problem → approach → takeaway without overclaiming.
- [ ] Introduction clearly states the gap and contribution.
- [ ] Related work is organized by themes (not a list dump).
- [ ] Methods/Approach is concrete and internally consistent.
- [ ] Results/Examples are specific (not purely aspirational).
- [ ] Discussion addresses tradeoffs and failure modes.
- [ ] Limitations are substantive and tied to assumptions.
- [ ] Conclusion restates the defensible contribution.

## Evidence & citations

- [ ] Every key factual claim has a citation or is labeled as hypothesis/assumption.
- [ ] Citations are placed next to the supported claim.
- [ ] References are complete and include stable links (DOI/URL).
- [ ] Disagreements in the literature are explicitly represented (when present).

## Consistency

- [ ] Terms are used consistently; definitions exist for key terms.
- [ ] No contradiction between abstract/introduction and later sections.
- [ ] Tone is scientific (precise, calibrated, not promotional).
