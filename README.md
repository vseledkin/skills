## Stenographer

Convert a user's dictated brainstorm (raw transcript, voice notes, meeting notes, scattered bullets) into a coherent scientific article draft with a rigorous structure, explicit assumptions, and verifiable citations. Use when the user wants an interactive "think aloud" workflow where Codex asks clarifying questions, distinguishes hypotheses from facts, optionally searches the web to confirm or refute claims, and—only with the user's approval—incorporates sourced statements and links into the evolving paper
